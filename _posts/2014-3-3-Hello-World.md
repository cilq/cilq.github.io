So this is it, an attempt of mine to create some sort of archive for my thoughts and the decisions they led to. I decided to do this in public, since it may occasionally contain knowledge valuable to others. That's also why I write this stuff in English and not in German - my mother tongue, so please excuse any mistakes in wording and grammar that may occur now and then.
What to expect? Not too much, I guess, since new content may come in an irregular fashion and in a wide variety of topics mostly dealing with technical stuff like software development, electronics and system administration with added grains of design and architecture.
So stand by while I get the appearance of this blog in shape and fill it with content.
